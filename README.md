# speech-recognition-app
From .wav to text using Python's SpeechRecognition module. I followed the sample project from The Codex.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Left to do:
- Disable button
- Display error message/page
- Display 'Loading...' while transcript is being generated
- Look into ways to make the transcript generation faster? (must look at SpeechRecognition docs)
- Make the page prettier
- Flask change detection: template file too
- Do something cool with the text itself (keywords...)
